# Core: Configuration System PRD (v2)

## 1. Purpose

The Configuration System is a core sub-component of the Launcher, responsible for loading, validating, and providing access to INI-based configuration files for all core systems, modules, CLI, and GUI. It is thread-safe, supports async operations (e.g., config reloads), structured results and error reporting, extensibility events for GUI, localization/i18n, and is fully testable and frontend-agnostic.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   Providing a thread-safe API for reading and writing configuration values from any thread or component (core, modules, CLI, GUI).
*   Supporting both synchronous and asynchronous configuration reloads to avoid blocking the main thread or performance-critical paths.
*   Returning structured results for all config queries and operations, including status, value, and structured error reporting.
*   Providing extensibility events/callbacks for GUI and other frontends (e.g., config reload notifications, value changes) so settings panels and dashboards can update in real time.
*   Supporting per-module and per-category configuration, dynamic config reloads, and runtime configuration changes.
*   All user-facing config keys, section names, and error messages must be localizable.
*   All APIs must be testable independently of the frontend.

## 3. Key Internal Interfaces/Classes (Conceptual)

*   **ConfigurationSystem**: The main orchestrating class for configuration. Exposes a frontend-agnostic API:
    *   `ConfigResult getValue(const std::string& section, const std::string& key)`
    *   `void setValue(const std::string& section, const std::string& key, const ConfigValue& value)`
    *   `void reloadConfig(AsyncCallback callback = nullptr)`
    *   `void subscribeToConfigEvents(ConfigEventCallback callback)`
    *   All methods must be thread-safe.
*   **ConfigResult**: A structured result for config queries, e.g.:
    ```cpp
    struct ConfigResult {
        enum class Status { Success, NotFound, Error };
        Status status;
        std::optional<ConfigValue> value;
        std::string message; // Localizable
        std::optional<StructuredData> data;
    };
    ```
*   **ConfigEventCallback**: A function or functor receiving config reload notifications, value changes, or error events (for GUI settings panels, dashboards, etc.).
*   **Async Operation**: ConfigurationSystem must support async config reloads to avoid blocking the main thread.
*   **Localization**: All config keys, section names, and error messages must be localizable.

### 3.1. Structured Results & Error Reporting

*   All config queries and operations must return structured results (see above) for easy consumption by CLI, GUI, and modules.
*   Config errors (e.g., parse failures, missing keys) must be reported as structured results, not just text.

### 3.2. Threading & Async Operation

*   All ConfigurationSystem APIs must be thread-safe.
*   Config reloads must support async operation and safe delivery of events/callbacks.
*   Config event callbacks (for GUI) must be delivered safely across threads.

### 3.3. Extensibility Events

*   The ConfigurationSystem must provide events/callbacks for:
    *   Config reload notifications
    *   Value changes
    *   Error events
*   GUI and other frontends must be able to subscribe to these events to update settings panels and dashboards dynamically.

### 3.4. Localization & Output Formatting

*   All user-facing config keys, section names, and error messages must be prepared for localization (i18n/l10n).
*   Config output formatting must be flexible: plain text for CLI, structured/styled for GUI, and machine-readable for external tools.

### 3.5. Testability & Automation

*   All ConfigurationSystem APIs must be testable independently of the frontend.
*   Automated tests should cover config value queries, async reloads, error handling, and extensibility events.

## 4. Interactions with Other Core Sub-components

*   **Module Loader System:**
    *   Modules can read/write config values, reload config, and subscribe to config events.
*   **CLI Engine:**
    *   CLI commands can query and update config, and subscribe to config events for output or automation.
*   **Event Bus:**
    *   Can publish config-related events (e.g., config reloaded, value changed).
*   **Logging System:**
    *   Can log config reloads, value changes, and errors.
*   **ICoreAccess Interface:**
    *   Provides access to the ConfigurationSystem for modules and frontends.

## 5. Output Formatting Standards

*   All config output must be localizable and support flexible formatting for CLI, GUI, and external tools.

## 6. Error Handling

*   All config errors (e.g., parse failures, missing keys) must be reported as structured results (see above), not just as text.
*   The ConfigurationSystem must log detailed error information for diagnostics.

## 7. Open Questions & Considerations

*   (Update as needed to reflect new requirements for async, structured results, extensibility events, localization, and testability.)

**This v2 PRD ensures the Configuration System is robust, extensible, and ready for both CLI and GUI frontends, with all modern requirements fully integrated.**
