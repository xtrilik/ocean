# Clipboard Module PRD (v2)

## Purpose
Provides clipboard management and history functionality as a dynamically loadable module. This v2 PRD fully integrates requirements for thread safety, async operation, structured results and error reporting, extensibility events for GUI, localization/i18n, and testability. All APIs are explicitly frontend-agnostic and ready for both CLI and GUI use.

## Public Interface
- CLI: `clipboard show history`, `clipboard clear`, `clipboard save`, `clipboard set debug on|off`, etc.
- Config: `[clipboard]` section in `clipboard.conf`
- Methods:
    - `init()`, `shutdown()`, `reloadConfig()`, `registerCLI()`, `selfTest()`
    - `ClipboardResult copy(const ClipboardData& data)`
    - `ClipboardResult paste()`
    - `ClipboardResult clearHistory()`
    - `void subscribeToClipboardEvents(ClipboardEventCallback callback)`
    - All methods must be thread-safe.

## Dependencies
- None (or list dependencies if needed)

## State Management
- Tracks clipboard history, current contents, and debug state.
- All state changes must be thread-safe.

## Event Publishing/Subscribing
- Publishes: `clipboard.copied`, `clipboard.pasted`, `clipboard.cleared`, `clipboard.history.changed` (all with structured payloads)
- Subscribes: `file.selected`, `core.shutdown`, etc.
- Provides extensibility events/callbacks for GUI and other frontends (clipboard state changes, errors, etc.).

## Error Handling
- All operations must return structured results (see below), not just text.
- Errors (e.g., copy/paste failures) must be reported as structured results and logged.

### Structured Results Example
```cpp
struct ClipboardResult {
    enum class Status { Success, Warning, Error };
    Status status;
    std::string message; // Localizable
    std::optional<ClipboardData> data;
};
```

## Performance Requirements
- Clipboard operations must complete in <100ms for typical data sizes.
- Async operations must not block the main thread or GUI.

## Testability & Automation
- All APIs must be testable independently of the frontend.
- Automated tests should cover copy, paste, clear, history, async operations, error handling, and extensibility events.

## Localization & Output Formatting
- All user-facing messages and data must be localizable (i18n/l10n).
- Output formatting must be flexible: plain text for CLI, structured/styled for GUI.

## Open Questions
- Should we support rich data types (images, files) in addition to text?
- How to handle clipboard monitoring on different platforms?
- How to handle clipboard access permissions in sandboxed environments?

**This v2 PRD ensures the Clipboard Module is robust, extensible, and ready for both CLI and GUI frontends, with all modern requirements fully integrated.**
